# TOP-EtchASketch

# Create a browser sketchpad 
- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs
    Made with Javascript

- Set up a hover effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them, making a pixelated trail through the grid

- Add a button that allows the user to set the size of the grid
    Doesn't change the size of the grid but rather the pixels within it

- Add buttons to change the colour of hover effect

- Make a random RGB value generator to change the colour of the hover effect to an unknown color


# Skills demonstrated

- Forming the HTML boilerplate
- Linking style sheets and Javascript files successfully
- Using CSS flexbox to structure a website aesthetically 
- Used Javascript and CSS to create a grid made up of pixels
- Created a Random RGB value function using Math functions
- Used event listeners and other DOM manipulations & events
- Using inline CSS to edit specific divs
- Using placeholder text


# Issues

- Initially the external CSS sheet was broken, I used 'src' rather than 'href' so fixed that

- Initially the Javascript was causing some issues, which was fixed once the keyword 'defer' was added, to make sure that the Javascript was being run last

- Had trouble with the Random RGB generator as I couldn't add the separate values into a string, solved when I used the concatenate symbol ` rather than the " symbol

- Found the project had to start from scratch, so watched a couple of other people doing it first and used their ideas as a starting point
